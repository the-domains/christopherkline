Pink Elephant

I am at the Columbus Zoo in Ohio photographing this elephant eating hay, straw, stromboli? I'm not quite sure. Nonetheless she goes about her business with methodical procedure in eating. Her eyes are closed. I can't read her gaze. I can't read her mind. What is it she thinks about? 

I am fascinated with the idea of comprehending her thoughts. Her eyes closed while she engages in her activity of eating. I begin to wonder, if she wonders, what if elephants were meant to be pink?
