Goat

Someone was explaining to me that a lot of artists struggle with the human figure. I don't know what the truth is, but I do know when I begin to hear sounds and words my mind immediately starts making pictures. And in doing so I bring you the inspiration behind the conversation this day.

I make of it this: Each ripple represents an idea that I've hoarded and collected. The memories of thoughts spread from my mind. Patterned outward. As if it has all been filed away and being released with order. The water will settle and eventuallly calm, not unlike the mind. It's just a pleasant place to be and a time to reflect "Ripples and Memories"

Pink Elephant

I am at the Columbus Zoo in Ohio photographing this elephant eating hay, straw, stromboli? I'm not quite sure. Nonetheless she goes about her business with methodical procedure in eating. Her eyes are closed. I can't read her gaze. I can't read her mind. What is it she thinks about? 

I am fascinated with the idea of comprehending her thoughts. Her eyes closed while she engages in her activity of eating. I begin to wonder, if she wonders, what if elephants were meant to be pink? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e35e7f61-b09a-4f52-a59e-af07adca3788.jpg)

Iris

By the light of the moon I could see her dance. As if time and youth had reversed this night. Our elderly neighbor Lois, crouching and rising like the waves of the ocean. My wife and I stood behind glass doors and could only wonder as she manipulated objects within her hands and lit them on fire!

Lauren was convinced she was practicing witchcraft. I have to admit Lois' baked cakes are deliciously addicting, her yard-wide "collection" of spare bottles and car parts has me obsessively curious and the day my brother flew off my motorcycle, landed in her yard and his shoes were gone AND she happened to see the whole thing.....but witchcraft? NAH......

Not unlike Lois is this very curious flower that comes to life in her yard. "Iris" - enjoy the peculiarities.

PUSH PULL PRINT 3

This is an art show poster I drew and screen printed for the Artists Group "Push Pull Print". We just had our third show and I wanted to make us a hand drawn, hand screen printed poster for the show.

The Etheric and The physical

The founding idea of this presentation of artwork was to invite artists to "PUSH" themselves and being accepted into the show solely on the idea: "What are you going to do to step outside of your current comfort zone?"

With this in mind I set out to invite a person with no artistic training or academic background in the arts to commence a painting for me. I would dictate the subject matter and provide whatever he/she needed in terms of photo references or answers to questions on how to handle the materials. My only request was that he/she finish the painting to the best of his/her abilities. Hand me a painting and call it "done". I would go into their painting and add my energy all the while attempting to keep his/her feeling of passion and mark making alive and not totally covering it up. I needed to look at the finished piece and feel the participants' piece beneath and within.

I asked my brother, Jeremiah if he would like to join me in my journey. He accepted without hesitation or visible uncertainty. I could praise him up and down for all the things he is, but to keep this short and to give you an idea of the challenge that lies ahead I will tell you he is a lawyer. He interprets words and language in a manner that are unfamiliar to me. I also believe he sees and processes images in a manner that my mind is not used to. These were to become obstacles in hindsight and not something I conceived in advance. This was my challenge on "PUSHING" the boundaries as an artist and an individual.

**The abridged interpretation of the final painting:**

I wanted to explore how graffiti artists are able to do graffiti on the sides of extremely tall buildings. I looked online and the solutions offered seemed to be more in line with commissions or pieces that were granted permission. Not something that would appear overnight. That was the question I sought to answer. The only viable solution I could conjure is simply they are suspended by a power greater than you or I. They have the ability to call upon the marionette spirits in the sky and are suspended by dangling "cables" controlled by a hand that you and I are unable to see. And so if they get to have imaginary means of spray painting tall buildings in a single bound then I shall have them paint a young girl on a swing. Something that would never happen on or even near the side of a building.

When Jeremiah gave me his finished painting I immediately began searching for words of what I was going to do. I would place the painting on my easel and search for the words. And search for words. After a great deal of time searching it dawned on me I think in terms of images and rarely give thought to associated words. My mind struggles with transferring images into that of a form of language. This was my hang up. Recognizing this, I began explaining, in words, on the canvas, what it was that I thought the interference was between his physical painting and the energy of my thoughts. Similar to a stream of conscious writing I would write how He struggles to interpret the images in his mind. I struggle to interpret the language in my mind. Finding it interesting that the energies (**The Etheric**) of the world we live in are more often than not being_interpreted, filtered and bridged_to the physical. Swinging, back and forth......

Sycamore

Peace Valley Park in Bucks County, Pennsylvania is home to a number of these gnarled, bark shifting trees known as "sycamores". As a kid I remember thinking these were the ugliest trees. Turns out my childhood was wrong and although I still can't wrap my head around them I find them to be unique and beautiful. The shell of these trees dance and change with light in a way I have not seen another tree do. The energy and play keeps me fascinated.

Fire and Ice

I received an email to enter last year's Naked In New Hope show. I didn't have any nude paintings so my work was cut out for me. I had just wrapped up 2 previous shows. One of which was entirely screen printed and the other was oil paintings. The first thing I needed to do was build the canvases and find a model. Unable to open my wallet because I didn't want to let the moths out I guess it would be better phrased I was in the market for a volunteer who would be openly willing to take their clothes off for me......

Uh-yeah-that didn't work out so well and I was running out of time. My wife suggested I just go online and find some naked people. Are you serious? People actually take their clothes off and go online? And it gets delivered to me visually through my own computer monitor?

After a bit of arduous "research" I found some images. It took me a lot longer to make the canvases and get them primed than I had hoped. The deadline for the Naked in New Hope show flew out the window and I had just got started.

So after a year of waiting and working on "Fire and Ice" I've been selected to show my latest piece along with "Waiting and Wondering".
